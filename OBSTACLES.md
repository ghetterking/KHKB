1. My flatmate isn't always available, so sometimes I have to just make decisions of my own for now even when it comes to design related stuff, because i can't lose too much time and sometimes it's not even that relevant anyway or i can change it later easily.
2. Decisions on what to put on GitHub, trello, google drive or local can get a bit a handful.
3. Wordpress and GitHub are surprisingly less than compatible. You can force it, yes, but it's quite a bit of work that otherwise isnt needed. Why Wordpress creates protected folders and files everywhere and why GitHub can't cope with it efficiently is beyond me, but I could fix it with Mirko's help eventually and it all works better than ever before.
4. Installing Wordpress only works if I use an old docker-compose.yml file, which can be corrupt if you mess sth up like I seemingly did. We get that file from trainers here for this purpose, but I'm not sure if I could pull this off at home without that help, even if I did google like crazy.
5. Finding the right themes and plugins is a big part of the whole task, also finding out how to make them work and so on.
6. The most frustrating part is when some plugins or even themes don't interact well with eachother and then you either have to work around it or replace them. Well, that and when you only notice too late that a function of a plugin is hidden behind a paywall and the entire thing is just bloated crippleware.
